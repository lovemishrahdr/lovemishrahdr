### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.

### My Digital Garden üå±


I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I automate things with **selenium** using **Java** and **Maven**.

I am interested in and talking about Selenium, Java, Maven, Jenkins, Test Data-Driven Development and Software Engineering ‚ô•Ô∏è |
