Hey there 👋,

I'm an automation developer on a mission to automate the boring stuff to focus on super productive stuff. I am passionate about learning and sharing my knowledge with others as widely as possible. If you found value in something I have created, please give me a shout out [@lovemishrahdr](https://twitter.com/lovemishrahdr), give some ♥ on [https://dev.to/lovemishrahdr](https://dev.to/lovemishrahdr)

### Tools & Tech Stack

I am interested in talking about Java, Selenium WebDriver, Apache POI/CommonsIO, Log4j2, Maven, Jenkins, Cucumber, TestNG, JUnit, Extent Reports & Continous Cloud Integration. Also, Framework Architecture such as Test Data-Driven Development, Behaviour Driven Development & Hybrid Development and Software Test Engineering ♥️  |

### Boy Scout Rule

I love open source.  I am not a heavy maintainer of any large libraries, but I really like the boyscout rule.  I contribute to things as I come across issues that I think other people might struggle with.  This may be things that are overlooked by someone who is deep into the library.

### My Digital Garden 🌱


I write about things I am familiar with, things that trip up folks that I mentor, and things that I am learning.  Day to day I automate things with **Selenium WebDriver** using **Java** and **Maven**.
